## Melanoma Detection
###  Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
### Steps:
1.Data Reading/Data Understanding 

2.Dataset Creation

3.Dataset visualisation

4.Model Building & training 

5.Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting 

6.Model Building & training on the augmented data 

7.Class distribution

8.Handling class imbalances: Rectify class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library

9.Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data
